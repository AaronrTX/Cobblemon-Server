1.) Fabric Loader

Click on the following link to install Fabric Loader,

Remember the cobblemon mod you installed earlier? Make sure to include that in the folder also,

So go to your downloads folder, or wherever you install the mod, and drag it to the mods folder

Your mod folder should look something like this:
